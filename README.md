# Irrationality of Pi

Visualizes the irrationality of pi

I saw a neat video that showed an animation of visualizing pi and decided to try it out with turtle.
There are some customizable variables but aside from that, it's just that, a visualization I decided to publish.

## Instructions:
Open a terminal window and run the file from there, to skip an input option for the default, press enter.
